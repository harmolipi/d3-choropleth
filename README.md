# D3 Choropleth

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/d3-choropleth).

## Functionality

This is the [Choropleth](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map) project, where I pull data from two APIs and visualize it in a choropleth map with the D3 library.

## Thoughts

I had to borrow quite a bit of guidance from the sample project, but I think I was able to understand the basics. This one was much like the previous heatmap project, but also had me scraping the surface of geojson and topojson too.

God bless.
